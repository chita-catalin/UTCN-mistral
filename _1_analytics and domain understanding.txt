analytics and domain understanding


first meta question:
I want to fine tune a large language model on energy consumption data in London. What good questions do you think this model should be able to answer?
LCL SmartMeter Cohort (2011–2014)

1) Trends & seasonality

What is the average summer temperature in London in 2013, and the % change year over year?

in the interval 1 January 2013 - 1 January 2014 where are the top 3 inflection points and what likely explains each?

What is the holiday vs non-holiday difference in daily energy consumption in London in 2012?

2) Load profiles & peaks

When did the site hit its monthly peak kW in August 2012, and what were the 15-minute values in the 2 hours before/after?

How does the typical weekday 24-hour energy load in London shape compared to weekend?

Since May 1, where are the change-points in night baseload (00:00–05:00), and how large is each step (ΔkW)?

3) London power-grid context

Who operates the transmission and distribution networks serving Greater London, and what are their distinct roles for a large customer?

When do system peaks typically occur in London, and what drivers (weather, commercial schedules) explain them?

How do DUoS, BSUoS, and time-of-use rates flow through a large London user’s bill, and which behaviors most affect each component?

4) Benchmarking & normalization

Which sites are most and least efficient by kWh/m² in 2025-Q2, and what are their values?

After weather normalization (HDD/CDD), does Site C still outperform Site A in 2025-H1? By how much (%)?

Which three meters contributed most to the YoY change in energy at Site B in 2025-Q2, and by how many kWh each?

5) Scenarios, strategy & communication

If we shift 30 kW from 17:00–20:00 to 02:00–05:00 on weekdays, what is the monthly bill impact, split into energy vs demand charges?

If we add 50 EV chargers (7 kW each) operating 17:00–20:00, what becomes the new peak kW, and what two mitigations would reduce it (with estimated savings)?

What would a five-bullet executive brief say were the top drivers of last month’s cost, and what one chart should accompany it (axes + metric)?
